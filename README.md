# STARTING C++
So recently i hit a writing block for coding (!). the silly stuff was boring and i wanted to learn REAL stuff. but i thought to my self... it's time to be a real man and leave this dynamic languages. so I started C++
My first program is just here for the sake of it, to say that i started C++ on 21th of september, 2025.
i want this to be my first language, not python. so it might take a while to be back....
AND OMG I FINALLY INSTALLED MSVC
